The purpose of Lab07 was to control gyroscope sensor to find the acceleration of an object, the temperature around the area and the orientation of the object(Beagle bone in this Case).
Four pins which are VCC, GND, XCL and XDA are connected to the bone. Analog input pins are used to read the data from the gyroscope. The gyroscope sends data in 8 bits each. After shifting by 8 bits and adding together corresponding elements together, we get the values of acceleration, temperature and gyroscope. After this we need to propagate 32 bit data by performing sign extension by forwarding and backwarding the 16 bit data by 16 bits, thus sending 32 bit data with the same value
